Product Built during Hack in The North 

Idea â€“ Hack in the North 3.0

Using disease profiles which contains severity and symptoms ,our code first predicts the possible disease the person can have. Now, we help the user by providing useful blogs and resources like medications, doctors to consult, home remedies, precautions, etc from all over the web. We will be having user accounts, and thus the user will upvote and downvote the resources based on his/her experience. Also, if a disease is encountered for the first time, the search algorithm is used for that time and the data is stored for any further requests. In this way, we are trying to create a Zomato  for healthcare.
